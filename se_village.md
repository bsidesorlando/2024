Get ready for the Social Engineering Adventure

Social Engineering Adventure is a fun filled village that focuses on the human side of cybersecurity. You'll get the opportunity to learn about some of the techniques used by the best in the industry. This year we have talks from both competitors and staff from the Social Engineering Community Village at DEF CON. This years Vishing competition winners and Black Badge holders, 'A Girl Has A Team', will be giving a talk on competing in the vishing competition and what it took to win in one of the most popular DEF CON competition.

The village will feature OSINT Challenges, from just a picture, can you figure out where that picture was taken? Do you think you can learn information about someone, starting with just a small piece of information?

What techniques do the professionals use to build trust, build rapport with people and get them to divulge information that perhaps they shouldn't be giving out? Learn how psychology can be used to build relationships with people in a short amount of time.

Join us at Social Engineering Adventure, where learning meets fun!
